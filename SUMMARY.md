# Implementation Summary

## Phase 1: Setup & Foundation ✅

### Project Setup
- Created Node.js (Express.js) project with ES6 modules
- Set up proper directory structure
- Configured environment variables
- Added security middleware (Helmet, CORS, Rate limiting)

### Core Modules

#### Auth Module
- JWT Auth (Access + Refresh tokens)
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Member)
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

#### User Module
- CRUD operations for users, profiles
- MongoDB integration with Mongoose
- User roles and permissions

### Docker Configuration
- Dockerfile for Node.js application
- docker-compose.yml with Node.js, Redis, MongoDB
- Environment configuration

## Phase 2: Real-Time Capabilities ✅

### WebSocket Integration
- Socket.io implementation for real-time communication
- Chat functionality with rooms
- User presence tracking
- Typing indicators
- Redis Pub/Sub for scaling across instances

### Notification System
- In-app notifications via WebSocket
- Email notifications via Inngest background jobs
- Redis storage for notification history
- REST API for notification management

## Phase 3: Core Features ✅

### Task Management
- CRUD APIs for projects and tasks
- Kanban-style column states (To-do, In Progress, Done)
- Deadline tracking with priority levels
- WebSocket broadcasting for real-time updates
- User assignment and project organization

### Document Collaboration
- CRUD APIs for documents
- MongoDB storage for documents (JSON/Markdown format)
- Real-time collaborative editing with WebSocket broadcasting
- Version history with snapshot storage
- Document restoration capabilities

## Phase 4: Event-Driven Workflows with Inngest ✅

### Inngest Integration
- Integrated Inngest SDK in Node.js application
- Defined events: task.created, doc.updated, chat.message
- Created background jobs with automatic retry functionality
- Implemented deadline scheduling (1 hour before due date)

### Email Notifications

- Integrated Nodemailer for email delivery
- Created email service utility functions
- Implemented various notification types:
  - Task reminders
  - Document update notifications
  - Chat message notifications

## Technologies Used
- Node.js with ES6+
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Redis for caching and pub/sub
- Socket.io for WebSocket communication
- Inngest for event-driven background jobs
- Nodemailer for email notifications
- Docker for containerization
- JWT for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Winston for logging

## Security Features
- Helmet for HTTP security headers
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- JWT token authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation

## Scalability Features
- Redis Pub/Sub for WebSocket scaling
- Stateless authentication with JWT
- Docker containerization
- Separation of concerns in code structure
- Event-driven architecture with Inngest
